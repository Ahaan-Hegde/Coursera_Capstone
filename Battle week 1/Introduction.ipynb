    "This project will help people to better explore facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York. The project will compare various location and venues around each of the neighbourhoods like cafes, schools, super markets, medical stores, shopping centres, theatres, hospitals, etc. This project aims to create an analysis of features for people wishing to move to Manhattan to search for the best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. An additional feature is included as comparison which is average rent. It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life."
